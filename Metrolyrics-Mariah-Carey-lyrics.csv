#Beautiful (Remix),2013,6,"Ah, ah, you're beautiful
(Yeah)
Ah, ah, you're beautiful
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you're killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you're killing me, baby do it again
You're beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You're beautiful, good lord, you're fucking beautiful
And I can't pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah
I like when you run red lights
Don't stop 'til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don't know
But I don't care, take me anywhere
'Cause it's beautiful, ooh you make me feel undressable
And I can't pretend that that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
You don't know what you're doing darling
Hop on back my bike darling
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Don't you worry darling",http://www.metrolyrics.com/beautiful-remix-lyrics-mariah-carey.html
100%,2009,32,"I am a dream, just beginning
Truth is I prayed when you'd open my eyes,
And you revealed something to me,
Suddenly I am no longer confined
My life ain't defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I'm a break through the door til I get in
Everything that I got I'm a give it
100 Percent and I ain't stopping til I reach the finish
I'm a believer, not just a dreamer
I'm givin everything I got
I'm a go getter
100 Percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way, babe
I am givin it 100 Percent
So go on put your ones up
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know that this is something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent
You can only do it if you do it like I did
Cause suffering ain't easy
But if you can turn your wounds into living proof
That you've survived the fight and you no longer defined
My life ain't defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I'm a break thru the door til I get in
Everything that I got Ima give it
100 Percent and I ain't stopping til I reach the finish
I'm a believer not just a dreamer

8th Grade,2018,6,"[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
That cigarette, put it out, put it out
Keep lookin' my way, turn around, turn around
This is a moment you can't buy
I see that longing in your eyes
[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me, then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I'm a confirmation, should you feel unsure
I'm that security when you're insecure
I'll be that baby girl when you're immature
Don't be ambivalent towards me
[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me, then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose (Nothing)
Never no pressure (Never)
Just put yourself into my shoes (Into my shoes)
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life (I'm not your life, oh baby I'm)
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life (Baby, I wanna be your life)
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules (Limitless)
Nothin' to lose (Nothing to lose)
Never no pressure (No pressure)
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life, baby
Ahh
[Outro: Mariah Carey & Timbaland]
Break it down
(I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you)
Said, I'm not your world
(By your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose)
Nothin' to lose, no pressure
Uh (Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose)
Nothing (C'mon, MC)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (C'mon)
Nothin' to lose, no pressure (Break it)
No pressure (Break it)
Ooh (C'mon, MC)
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Uh, c'mon)
La-da-da-da-da-da, I'm not your life (What you say, girl?)
Limitless, without no rules (Break it)

What you say, girl?

A Girl Can Dream,2009,6,"Hoh woh hoh, hoo hoo
When I was a child, the story would say
Somebody will sweep you off your feet some day
That's what I hoped would happen with you
More than you could know
I wanted to tell you that my heart's in your hands
I prayed for the day that I would get the chance
Just when I worked up the courage to try
Much to my surprise
You had somebody else, yeah
'Cause these feelings I keep to myself
[Chorus:]
I may never get to hold you so tight
I may never get to kiss you goodnight
I may never get to look deep in your eyes
Or so it seems
I always will be wishin' you were mine
I'll think about what could be all the time
All the happiness that I could find
Baby, a girl can dream
From the moment I wake up till I fall asleep
I imagine you're not with her but with me
Talkin' and laughin', sharin' our dreams
But it's just a fantasy
'Cause you have somebody else
'Cause these feelings I keep to myself, eh yeah
[Repeat CHORUS on the background]
I may never get to hold you
Goodnight
Baby, I'm wishing
Tonight, tonight, tonight
All the time
[Bridge:]
A girl can dream, it's true
And to call you my own
It's the sweetest dream I know
Ooh
[Repeat CHORUS on the background]
So tight
No, no, no, never, ooh
Wishin' you were mine
Could be all the time
Hoo
Hoh
Hoo",http://www.metrolyrics.com/a-girl-can-dream-lyrics-mariah-carey.html
